# rock-paper-scissors

This is a project I created from a project assignment at The Odin Project.

A few things that it forced me to better understand:
Array's
Passing arguments into Functions
Calling outside Functions from within a Function
If Else statements
Inserting variables into a string
Console logging multiple variables at once.
